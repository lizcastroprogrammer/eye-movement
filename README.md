# Eyes
## Description
This app mimics two eyes following the movement of the cursor on the screen. Whatever direction the cursor moves the eyes will follow. It uses JavaScript events to detect the motion of the cursor and functions that update the location of the "eye-balls" on the screen. 
## How to Run
Load up the program into your browser and move the cursor around the screen.
## Future Improvements
I plan to update in the future with a button that allows the user to add more eyes.
